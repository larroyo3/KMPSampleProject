## üì± Project Overview
**KMPSampleProject** is a sample mobile application built with **Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)**, **Jetpack Compose**, and **SwiftUI**. This project demonstrates best practices for clean architecture and modular design in cross-platform mobile apps. It serves as a reference for developers aiming to create maintainable and scalable mobile projects.

## üõ† What is Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) and Jetpack Compose?
**Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)** allows code sharing across platforms like Android and iOS, enabling the development of native apps with shared business logic. **Jetpack Compose** is Google's modern toolkit for building Android UIs, while **SwiftUI** plays a similar role for iOS. Together, they allow for streamlined, performant cross-platform development.

## üèóÔ∏è How to Build the App

#### Android
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-repo.git`
2. Open the project in **Android Studio**.
3. Sync the Gradle files.
4. Run the app on an **Android emulator** or physical device.

#### iOS
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-repo.git`
2. Open the iOS project in **Xcode**.
3. Select your target device (simulator or physical).
4. Run the app.

## üåç Global Best Practices Implemented

This is a Kotlin Multiplatform project targeting Android and iOS.

- `/composeApp` contains code shared across Compose Multiplatform applications, with `commonMain` for shared code and platform-specific folders (e.g., `iosMain`).
- `/iosApp` holds the entry point for the iOS app, with any required SwiftUI code.
- `/shared` is for code shared between all platforms.

Here are the global coding practices applied across the entire project:

<!--
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clean separation between UI, business logic, and data layers using the **Clean Architecture** pattern. 
- **Dependency Injection**: Implemented with **Koin**/**Dagger** for better scalability and decoupling.
- **Immutable Data**: Wherever possible, we use immutable data structures to avoid unexpected side effects.
- **Centralized State Management**: Utilizing **StateFlow** or **LiveData** for predictable and maintainable UI state.
- **Test Coverage**: Unit tests ensure high code reliability and ease of refactoring.
-->

> **Note**: Since this project is still in its early stages, additional best practices and refinements will be implemented as development progresses.

## üß© Module-Specific Best Practices

Each module in the project follows its own set of best practices. Here's a quick breakdown:

<!--
### üè† Home Module
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: The **Home** module is focused solely on displaying the app's main dashboard.
- **Dynamic Feature Loading**: Each tile in the dashboard links to a separate, dynamically loaded feature module.

### üë§ Profile Module
- **MVVM Architecture**: Separation of concerns using the **Model-View-ViewModel** pattern.
- **Reactive State Handling**: Uses **StateFlow** for efficient UI state management.

### üì¶ Qbox Module
- **Efficient Caching**: Implements local caching to minimize network requests and ensure smooth performance.
- **Offline Support**: Built with offline-first principles, ensuring the module works without an active internet connection.
-->

> **Note**: As modules are still being developed, these best practices will continue to evolve.
